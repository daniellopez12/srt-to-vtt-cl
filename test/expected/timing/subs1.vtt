00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.600
This blade has a dark past.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.900
It has shed much innocent blood.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.550
You're a fool for traveling alone,
so completely unprepared.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.900
You're lucky your blood's still flowing.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.400
Thank you.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.100
So...

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.900
What brings you to
the land of the gatekeepers?

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.600
I'm searching for someone.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.300
Someone very dear?
A kindred spirit?

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.100
A dragon.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.850
A dangerous quest for a lone hunter.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.970
I've been alone for
as long as I can remember.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.600
We're almost done. Shhh...

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.600
Hey, sit still.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.350
Good night, Scales.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.950
Get him, Scales! Come on!

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.350
Scales?

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.600
Yeah! Come on!

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.100
Scales!

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.600
I have failed.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.600
You've only failed to see...

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.600
These are dragon lands, Sintel.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:44.100
You are closer than you know.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.600
Scales!

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.100
Scales?

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.900
Scales...
